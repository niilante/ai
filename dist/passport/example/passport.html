    Passport module assists in securing routes and elements withing your application. This is done by calling an endpoint
    on the server which returns the authenticated user, their roles and the global roles for the application. All api
    endpoint routes along with their actions can be configured.
</p>
<p>
    For example you may wish to have users directed to
    another route instead of the default '/'. You may do this by specifying the onLoginSuccess handler. This handler
    as well as all "on" handlers accept either a path withing the application or a function. A function can be used to
    do some custom logic upon the login. Functions are good for when you want to say redirect the user on login to his
    authenticated area or dashboard as oppossed to a catch all path.
